            <p>The <a href="http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs) are a universal call to action to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>end poverty</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>protect the planet</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>improve the lives and prospects of everyone, everywhere</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The 17 Goals were adopted by all UN Member States in 2015, as part of the <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld">2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development</a>.</p>
